he "Emoji to Text Converter" project, built in Python, is designed to convert emojis into their corresponding text descriptions. The project uses various types of emojis, including facial expressions, animals, objects, and symbols, and maps each one to a specific text meaning. By utilizing a dictionary or predefined mapping, the program reads an input string or text that includes emojis and returns the text form of the emojis.
